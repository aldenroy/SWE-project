# SWE-project
This was a team project for learning testing frameworks, git/github functionality, 
and the CI/CD workflow. There were 4 parts. Unit tests, Integration tests, Cypress
test, and CI/CD. I specifically worked on all Cypress tests, fixing some errors
in the unit tests, and helping with the CI/CD portion.
